Osmify
======

OSMify is built for two purposes:

* Import [Lantm√§teriets GSD data](http://www.lantmateriet.se/Kartor-och-geografisk-information/Kartor/Sverigekartor/GSD-Sverigekartor-vektor/) from Shape files to PostGis
* Package (parts of) the data in a form that more resembles OpenStreetMap's structure, particularily to be able to use MapBox's [OSM Bright](https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright) styling with as few modifications as possible.
